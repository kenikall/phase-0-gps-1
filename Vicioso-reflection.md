What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
-Majority of the github functions were pretty foreign to me. This includes cloning, pulling, and pushing files.


What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
-Cloning and pulling repo's were clarified for me.


What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I confirmed a lot of syntax with my pair and guide.


What still confuses you about Git?
I feel like I am at a pretty good understanding of how github works for now.

How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
-Essentially its two brains working together. I feel like I learned a lot more efficiently than I would have by myself. Switching back and forth from a driver and navigator is a really cool strategey to solidify understanding of these concepts.
