#What Git concepts were you struggling with prior to the GPS session?
Definately struggled with the GIT/gitHub interface. Walking through it with other people helped me understand much better

#What concepts were clarified during the GPS?
I have a much better undertstanding of how devs can manage thier workflow  with a GitHb.

#What questions did you ask your pair and the guide?
I askerd a lot of questions about push requests. It was good to see what push requests looked like from both the sender and reciever prespectives.

#What still confuses you about Git?
I think I am at a point where I don't know what I don't know. I think I will have more questions as I play with the interface more.

#How was your first experience of pairing in a GPS?
I was beyond nervous but Willington was great to work with and our guide made the experience smooth by not saying much and letting us fumble a bit. We went well over the hour alloted but that might be intentional.
